The **DiABlu Project** is a collection of tools that (mostly) use the Open Sound Control to facilitate the creation of digital art installations.

DiABlu is a project conceived by **Jorge Cardoso** at the School of Arts of the Portuguese Catholic University and developed at the Research Center for Science and Technology in Art (CITAR).


**Anton Vanhoucke** has also contributed to this project by adding new features to the NXTCommProcessing library.
Anton studied design and engineering and loves robots and lego. So he plays with Mindstorms. The cool stuff about robotics these days is that you can connect to everything: laptops, phones, web servers, camera's, raspberry pi's and arduino's. So that's what Anton builds. Because he can.
